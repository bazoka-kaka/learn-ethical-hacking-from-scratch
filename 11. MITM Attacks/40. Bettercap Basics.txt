> bettercap --help 

after openning bettercap 
------------------------
>> help 
note:
this is to get the list of all of the commands in 
bettercap 

- what we really wanna pay attention to now: 
the modules after you ask help in bettercap 

>> help [moduleName]
note:
this is gonna show how to use the specific module 

example:
>> help net.probe

note:
net.probe is for sending UDP packets 
to discover devices on the same network 

>> net.probe off
note:
this is to turn off the net.probe or you 
can turn it on using the on keyword 

- we're now gonna turn on the net.probe 
>> net.probe on 
note:
this is gonna start discovering clients connected to the 
same network 

this will also automatically start 
the net.recon 

reason:
net.probe sends request to all possible IPs 
then net.recon will be the one detecting the response

net.recon --> this is for detecting responses

>> net.show 
note:
this is gonna show all the connected clients 
this is only gonna work after we activated:
a. net.probe 
b. net.recon 

note:
in the table:
name --> the type of device 
example:
gateway, wlan0 

vendor --> hardware used in each of these networks
