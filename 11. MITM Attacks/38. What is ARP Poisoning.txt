WHAT I ARP POISONING 
====================

- the hacker is gonna be in the middle of the connection 
between a user and the internet (not the router but it's replaced by us)

client --> us --> router --> internet 
or 
internet --> router --> us --> client 

ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL (ARP)
---------------------------------

- simple protocol used to map IP address of a machine 
to its MAC address 
(bassically to link IP addresses to MAC addresses)

- how to get the mac address of another device? 
1. sends ARP request to all of the devices 
in the range 
2. the only one that's gonna respond to the sender is the one 
that has the ip address that the sender sends 
3. the rest will ignore the request 

- the response is the ip address and the mac 
address of the target 

- each computer has an ARP table which links IP addresses 
of the same network to their MAC addresses

> arp -a 
note:
this command is gonna show the arp table 

- anytime a computer sends a request to the internet, 
it'll direct that request to the MAC address of the router 

note:
the value of the router's mac address could be changed using 
ARP protocol to our mac address therefore, we can be the man in the middle 
because the target will think that we are the router (they're 
gonna send their responses to our mac address)

- we're gonna send two responses, one to the gateway, 
and another to the target 

we're gonna tell the gateway that we're the victim, 
and to the victim that we're the gateway

(by changing the arp table of each to our mac address as its destinations)

ARP SPOOFING 
------------

why arp spoofing is possible:
1. clients accept responses even if they did not send a request 
2. clients trust response without any form of verification
