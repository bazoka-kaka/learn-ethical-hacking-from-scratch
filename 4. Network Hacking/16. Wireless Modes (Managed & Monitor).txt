WIRELESS MODES (MANAGED AND MONITOR)
====================================

- when you communicate with other devices through your router:
you use a package 

- each package contains mac address so that it knows where to go
and identifies itself

- the package contains these two things:
a. destination mac 
b. source mac 

- to capture all of these package, need to change 
to monitor mode : you're gonna receive everything 
that is in the range of your vm (not only the things 
that are intended to be sent to you)

- shows all the wireless interfaces:
> iwconfig

note:
we can see the mode here (by default is managed)

this means that it'll only capture devices that has the destination 
mac as our virtual machine 

(only capturing things that are meant to sent to the vm)

- changing to monitor mode:
killing the wlan:
> ifconfig wlan0 down 
killing all the processes that could interupt when changing to monitor mode:
> airmon-ng check kill 
note:
you also killed your internet connection 
enable monitor mode:
> iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor 
reenabling the interface:
> ifconfig wlan0 up

- returning to managed mode and restart internet connection:
> service NetworkManager restart
