ARPSPOOFING USING BETTERCAP
- framework to run network attacks
- can be used to:
-- arp spoof targets (redirect the flow of packets)
-- sniff data (urls, username, passwords)
-- bypass HTTPS
-- redirect domain requests (DNS spoofing)
-- inject code in loaded pages
-- and more
use:
bettercap -iface [interface]

note: bettercap could be used exactly what we did with arp spoof
so we can use it to run an arp spoofing attack, to intercept
connections and it can be  used to do so much more, we can
use it to capture data and analyze it and see usernames and 
passwords, bypass https and potentially bypass hsts, dns spoofing, 
inject code into loaded pages, and so on

this is showing all the things you can do with bettercap command:
> bettercap --help

this is the command to run bettercap:
> bettercap -iface wlan0

note: this is strange since it uses -iface not -i

now we are inside the bettercap (not the usual kali linux terminal)

to show all the commands we can do with bettercap:
>> help

note: what's really important is the modules
so theses are all the modules that we can get or all the things
that we can get bettercap to do

we can type "help" followed by any modules there is 
this will show you a help menu that shows you how to use
this specific module

example: we are going to show the net.probe and net.recon module

this is the command: 
>> help net.probe

now we want to do this:
>> net.probe on

note: this will start discovering clients connected to the same
network as us

and after we turned net.probe on we are going to see
if we type "help" again the net.recon automatically gets
turned on too

this is because net.probe sends probe requests to all possible 
ips and then if we get a response, the net.recon will be
the one detecting this responses by monitoring my ARP cache
then add all these IPs in a nice list so
we can target them. 

after net.recon  is already running, we can do net.show
to show all the clients connected to the network
this is the command:
>> net.show

start up
uncanny encounter
crush landing on you

to see all the help with arp.spoof:
>> help arp.spoof

set the arp.spoof.fullduplex to make the spoofing attack
2 ways:
>> set arp.spoof.fullduplex true

set the targets:
>> set net.spoof.targets (targets)
example:
>> set net.spoof.targets 192.168.1.24

run the spoofing attack:
>> arp.spoof on
