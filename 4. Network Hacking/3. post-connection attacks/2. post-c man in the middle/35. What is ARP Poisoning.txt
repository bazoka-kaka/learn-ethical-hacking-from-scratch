These are attacks that we can do only if we can intercept
the communication between 2 devices hence the name
man in the middle atacks

in the man in the middle attack, the hacker will be able to 
place themselves in the  middle of connection between 
two devices.

ARP SPOOFING ATTACK
--> this is redirecting the flow of packets instead of flowing
right from target to target, it's gonna flow through our computers
first then we redirect the flow to another target, 
we could literally do anything to that information or packets
before redirecting it in a really fast speed

ARP (ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL)
--> this is simple protocol used to map IP address of a machine to 
its MAC addresses
--> you have to know the mac addresses of both the target by
doing some ARP protocol 
--> this is how it happens: 
- sends broadcast message (ARP requests) to every devices
connected to the network
- the only ones answering are the ones that is requested
by anyone sending the ARP requests. The response
is called an ARP response
note:
an ARP response consists of 2 things:
-- mac address of that device
-- ip address of that device

note:
MAC address is the ones used for communication between devices
all these things or communications are used or facilitated
using the ARP protocol

the whole point of ARP requests is just so that we could link
ip addresses to mac addresses or translate ip addresses
to mac addresses

each computer has something called ip tables which links ip addresses
on the same network to their mac addresses

this is the command on most of the available operating system: 
> arp -a
note: this is going to show us an arp table

we are sending 2 arp responses:
1. to the gateway:
we are telling the gateway that we are at the ip address of the 
victim then will associate the mac address of the gateway
with our own mac address
2. to the victim:
we are telling the victim that we are at the ip address of 
the gateway then will associate the mac address of the target
with our own mac address

therefore the victim is gonna think we are the router and
the router will think that we are the victim at the same time

WHY ARP SPOOFING IS POSSIBLE:
1. clients accept responses even if they did not send a request
2. clients trust response without any form of verification
