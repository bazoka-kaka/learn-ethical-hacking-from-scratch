NETWORK MAPPING NMAP/ZENMAP
- HUGE security scanner
- from an IP/IP range it can discover:
-- open ports
-- running services
-- operating systems
-- connected clients
-- + more

note:
nmap works far better than netdiscover since it covers 
a whole lots more things than netdiscover

you'll see all the things like the open ports, programs
running on those ports, determine the computer name, 
the operating system running on that computer, 
if you are on a network, you'll be able to discover 
all of the connected clients, bypass security, firewalls, 
and much more

Nmap is so huge that it has books and complete courses 
just covering nmap

-- you just open zenmap:
> zenmap

insert the ip address range on the target example: 
192.168.1.0/24

then choose a profile.
1. ping scan
This time we are going to do some ping scan
note: this ping attack will show devices connected 
to the same network as us. a lot of them will not response
on the ping scan even if they are alive
MEANING THIS PING SCAN WILL NOT SHOW ALL THE DEVICES
CONNECTED ON THE SAME NETWORK

we could see the vendor of these devices also
example: HTC, Apple, Cisco

2. quick scan
this is slower than ping scan but shows more information
note:
this is also showing up the open ports other than those
shown on the ping scan

note:
port 22 or ssh is a system that allows us to remote access it
meaning we are going to be able to function like a controller to it
