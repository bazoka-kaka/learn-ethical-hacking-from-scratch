--> you can't gain access to a system if you don't have enough 
information about it

INFORMATION GATHERING
- discover all devices on the network
- display their: 
-- IP address
-- MAC address
-- operating system
-- open ports
-- running services
-- etc

examples of programs to do this job really2 well:
- nmap
- netdiscover

this is using netdiscover:
> netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24

note:
-r this is the ip range that could be accessed by you

this is not doing anything since this is not connected to a wifi network
you have to use the wireless adapter aaand you have to make
the natnetwork disabled so that you can scan from the 
wifi network

this is how: 

devices -> network -> uncheck Connect Network Adapter

note:
this is not working on virtualbox
