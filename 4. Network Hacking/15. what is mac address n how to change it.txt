WHAT IS MAC ADDRESS AND HOW TO CHANGE IT 
========================================

- MAC - Media Access Control
a. permanent
b. physical
c. unique

- assigned by manufacturer 

- ip address --> IP addresses are used to uniquely identifies the connection of 
the network with that device takes part in a network.

- mac address --> MAC Address is used to ensure the physical address of the computer

MAC, address -- identifies a device to other devices on the same local network. 
The internet address -- or IP address -- identifies the device globally

local identification vs. global identification;
Layer 2 vs. Layer 3 operation;
physical address vs. logical address;
number of bits;
address assignment and permanence; and
address formatting.

The MAC address is only significant on the LAN to which a device is connected, 
and it is not used or retained in the data stream once packets leave that network.

Any piece of internet software, such as a web browser, directs data to a destination 
on the internet using the destination's IP address.

IP address is bound to a network device via software configurations, and network 
administrators can change it at any time.
Media access control refers to the piece of hardware that controls how data is 
pushed out onto a network.

A MAC address consists of 12 hexadecimal digits,
usually grouped into six pairs separated by hyphens.

- mac address is to transfer data between devices 

- WHY CHANGE MAC ADDRESS?
a. increase anonimity
b. impersonate other device
c. bypass filters 

- in kali:
inet --> this is the ip address
ether --> this is the mac address 

- disabling an interface:
> ifconfig wlan0 down

- changing the mac:
> ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55

note:
hw --> means change 
ether --> means we wanna change the mac address 

- enabling the interface:
> ifconfig wlan0 up
