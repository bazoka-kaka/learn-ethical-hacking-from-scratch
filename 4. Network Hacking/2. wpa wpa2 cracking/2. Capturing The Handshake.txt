WPA/WPA2 CRACKING
- fixed all weaknesses in WEP
- packets contain no useful data.
- only packets that can aid with the cracking processes
are the handshake packets.
-- these are 4 packets sent when a client connects to the network

the handshake packets are actually the only ones that are
useful and they are got from when someone tries to connect
to the router's network

1. CAPTURING THE PACKETS
this is the command: 
> airodump-ng --bssid (router's mac) --channel (router's channel)
--write wpa_handshake wlan0

2. deauthenticating a client to make the client give us a 
handshake packets

this is the command: 
> aireplay-ng --deauth 4 -a (router's mac) -c (client's mac) wlan0

note:
> --deauth usually is really big but this time this is really small
therefore you are going to make the client don't notice 
that he's being disconnected
