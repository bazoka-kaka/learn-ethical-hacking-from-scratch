WPA/WPA2 Cracking

Two things needed to crack WPA/WPA2:
1. 4-way handshake
2. wordlist.

this is how the password is matched: 
MIC or message integrity code is what's used by the access point 
to verify whether a password is correct or not
it's gonna separate this and put this on the side, and
then it's going to put all the informations in the left then 
combine them with the first password in the wordlist 
to generate an MIC, another message integrity code
then it's going to compare it with the one on the handshake packet
that we just created, then if the password is wrong, it's gonna
move to the next key

this is how it's explained simply:
a. take a wordlist key
b. merge with MIC
c. compare with the password from the handshake 
d.1 if false then go back to a to the next word list key
d.2 if true then go enter the network

this is the command:
> aircrack-ng (handshake file name.cap) -w (wordlist file name.txt)

real example: 
> aircrack-ng test.cap -w handshake.txt
