to see all the networks that has wps that is enabled:
this is the command: 
> wash --interface wlan0

we don't care about whether it's wpa or wpa2 
because we are going to be exploiting a feature
if enabled is going to connect us

note:
if you see that Lck is No meaning you can try this attack

things to do:
1. associate with the target network
using fake authentication attack
--> this says i want to communicate with you, please
don't ignore me so that when the attack runs, the
network will start accepting the PINs

note:
PIN - personal identification number 

this is the command:
> aireplay-ng --fakeauth 30 -a (mac address of target router) 
-h(mac addres of our wireless adapter) wlan0

note:
> --fakeauth 30 meaning you are going to associate every 30 seconds

2. run reaver
reaver is a program that will bruteforce the pin
and only then (after we run the reaver stuff) will we
associate with the target.
YOU HAVE TO RUN THIS REAVER FIRST AFTER THAT YOU ASSOCIATE
WITH THE TARGET!

this is the command: 
> reaver --bssid (the target router's bssid) --channel (the 
target router channel) --interface (the interface) -vvv --no-associate

note:
-vvv meaning you are making the reaver showing as much information
as possible if it runs into an error
--no-associate meaning you are making reaver not to associate
with the target network because this is really buggy 
and you don't want to use this, since you already trying to
associate using the aireplay-ng thing

steps:
1. press enter in the reaver
2. press enter in the association of aireplay-ng

if you get bugs, they still haven't fixed it meaning it's better
to use an older version

this is the reaver's download link:

after that to use this reaver:
(in the directory where you store the reaver's download file)
> chmod +x reaver
> ./reaver --bssid (the target router's bssid) --channel (the 
target router channel) --interface (the interface) -vvv --no-associate
