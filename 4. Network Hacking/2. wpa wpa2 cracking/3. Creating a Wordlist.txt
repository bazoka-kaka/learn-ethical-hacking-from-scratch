WPA/WPA2 CRACKING
- the handshake does not contain data the helps recover the key
- it contains data that can be used to check if a key is valid
or not

the handshake doesn't contain any information that can help us
to recover or recalculate the WPA key. the information in it 
can only be used to check whether a password is valid or not

therefore we have to create a wordlist containing any possible
combinations to findout whether one of them is correct or not
and if one of them matches, the password is found

note:
you can download the password lists from the internet

THIS IS HOW YOU CREATE A WORDLIST
Crunch can be used to create a wordlist

syntax:
> crunch[min][max][characters]-t[pattern]-o[FileName]

example: 
> crunch 6 8 123abc$ -o wordlist -t a@@@@b

generated passes: 
aaaaab
aabbbb
aan$$b

note:
this is going to create a combination of 123abc$ to the 
wordlist also 6 as its minimum character and 8 as its maximum
-o meaning it's going to be stored in a file called wordlist
> -t meaning  it's got this pattern of a@@@@b

> man crunch
note:
this is going to give the instructions and all the things
you can do with crunch 

-p meaning telling crunch to generate password that don't have
repeating character for example: 
aaaaab <-- this is not going to be stored by crunch since
it's not likely that a password will be seen like that

this is the example: 
> crunch 6 8 abc12 -o test.txt

note:
the min length is 6 and the max is 8
then the combinations is abc12 and the file where
we are going to store them is test.txt

to open the file this is the command: 
> cat test.txt


jokokav92

> crunch 9 9 jokav92 -t jok@ka@92 -o wordlist

crunch min max characters -t patterns -o filename.txt

aircrack-ng something.cap -w wordlist
