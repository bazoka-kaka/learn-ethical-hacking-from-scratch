WPA/WPA2 CRACKING
- both can be cracked using the same methods
- made to address the issues in WEP
- much more secure
- each packet is encrypted using a unique temporary key

--> packets contain no useful information

the only difference between wpa and wpa2 is the encryption
used, 
WPA uses TKIP
WPA2 uses CCMP

WPA/WPA2 CRACKING ARP REQUEST REPLAY
- WPS is a feature that can be used with WPA and WPA2
- allows clients to connect without the password
- authentication is done using an 8 digit pin
-- 8 digits is very small
-- we can try all possible pins in relatively short time
-- then the WPS pin can be used to compute the actual password

PS: This only works if the router is configured not to use
PBC (Push Button Authentication)

we are not actually encrypting some WPA or WPA2 stuffs, 
but we are exploiting a feature if enabled, could be used
to enter  into the network

first, the wps has to be enabled on the network because
it can't be disabled, also it needs to be misconfigured
meaning it needs to be configured to use a normal PIN 
authentication and not a Push Button Authentication

if push button authentication is used, then the router will refuse
any PINs that we try unless the WPS button is pressed on the router

meaning in real life, WPS is going to be enabled by default
or the PBC is going to be enabled by default meaning
you have to actually set it
