DEAUTHENTICATION ATTACK

Disconnect any client from any network
- works on encrypted networks (WEP, WPA, WPA2)
- No need to know the network key
- No need to connect to the network

use:
aireplay-ng --deauth [deauthpackets] -a [NetworkMac]
-c [TargetMac] [Interface]

this attack allows us to disconnect any device
from any network before connecting to these networks

how this works:
1. we change our MAC address to the MAC
address of the target client
2. tell the router that we want to disconnect 
from it
3. pretend to be the router again by changing the router's
MAC address
4. tell the client that the client requested
to disconnect from it so the router is going to 
disconnect it

this will allow us to deauthenticate any client from any
network

we're not going to do this manually we are going to 
use a tool that is called aireplay-ng

this is the command: 
> aireplay-ng deauth 10000000 -a (mac of target router)
-c (client's mac address) wlan0

note:
you want to make a really big number therefore
you are going to deauthenticate for a longer period
of time and the only way to get that particular device
to connect to the internet again is to press
ctrl + c from aireplay-ng

this command is not enough sometimes so you have to actually
run airodump-ng againts your target network

so the solution is:
1. you have to use airodump-ng againts your target
network
2. you do the aireplay-ng attack againts both your
client device and your target router

this is the attack:
> airodump-ng --bssid (bssid of router) --channel 
(router's channel) wlan0
> aireplay-ng deauth 10000000 -a (router's mac)
-c (client's mac) wlan0

SOCIAL ENGINEERING:
1. disconnect target from its network
2. call the user and pretend to be a person from
the departement of IT department 
3. ask them to install a virus or a backdoor
telling them this will fix their issue
you could also set, create other fake access point
and get them to connect to fake access point
and then start spying on them from that access point

you can also use this to capture the handshake
this is vital in WPA cracking and we'll talk about it
once we go to the WPA cracking stuff
