WHAT IS MAC ADDRESS?
- Media Access Control
permanent
physical 
unique
- Assigned by manufacturer to any device interfaces

this MAC address is always there whether it's just a 
wireless card, wired card, Ethernet card
you are going to find anything that is called a 
MAC address

this is unique and there is none that is the same
for their MAC address

this will always be the same forever unless we change
it which is temporary and after you unplug your device
or restart it you will see that its mac address is
going back to the original one

IP = to identify computers and communicate between
devices on the internet 

MAC = to identify devices and transfer data between
devices.

each piece of data or packet that is sent within 
the network contain something that is called
a destination mac and a source mac

this packet will flow the source MAC to the destination MAC

WHY CHANGE THE MAC ADDRESS?
1. increase anonimity 
2. impersonate other devices
3. bypass filters

this is how:
> ifconfig wlan0 down
> ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
> ifconfig wlan0 up
note:
ifconfig - show all the network interfaces on our kali 
machine 
network interface - any device that allows us to connect
to the internet ex: wifi card, Ethernet card, and
so on
eth0 - this is a virtual interface that is created
by virtual box when we set kali to use a nat network
ether - contains the information of the MAC address
of this virtual interface
hw - this is a command to change something

to change the MAC address you have to first disable 
the interface
