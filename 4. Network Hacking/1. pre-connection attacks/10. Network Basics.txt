TYPICAL NETWORK
A network usually have clients connected to each
other and clients usually are connecting to networks
to share data or resources example of resource:
internet

wifi or wired work with the same principle

they have:
a server (a device) example of a server is a router
in our hom network. server is also called an
access point

the only thing that has access to a resource is called 
an access point/server
none of the client has an access to resource
without going through a server

data that is transferred between a client and an access point
is in form of a packet

everything that is transmitted between access point
and clients is called packets of datas

for wifi these packets are transmitted between air
if you are in range you'll be able to see
all the packets that they do on the internet
therefore you are going to be able to see all the information
you are going to need
