WIFI BANDS
- decides the frequency range that can be used
- determines the channels that can be used
- clients need to support band used by router to communicate
with it
- data can be sniffed from a certain band if the wireless
adapter used supports that band

Most common WiFi Bands are:
- a uses 5 Ghz frequency only
- b, g both uses 2.4 Ghz frequency only
- n uses 5 and 2.4 Ghz
- ac uses frequencies lower than 6 Ghz

our previous airodump-ng is not scanning all the
wireless networks there is but it just do this 
scanning of the 2.4 Ghz frequency

SNIFFING AND DISCOVER 5 Ghz NETWORKS
--> you need to make your wireless adapter to listen
to both the 2.4 and 5 Ghz channels
this is the command: 
> airodump-ng --band a wlan0
note:
this is going to capture all the 5 Ghz only 

what you can also do: 
you can specify multiple bands for the same band 
command:
this is the command:
> airodump-ng --band abg wlan0

note:
this is going to capture 5 and 2.4 Ghz networks
also clients that is connected to both bands

the problem: 
you need a powerful wireless adapter and it's going
to be slightly slower

if you want quicker results you just do some band a

to sniff data from 5 Ghz frequency, your adapter needs
to support the sniffing of those datas therefore
you aren't going to be able to do so if your band
doesn't support those things
