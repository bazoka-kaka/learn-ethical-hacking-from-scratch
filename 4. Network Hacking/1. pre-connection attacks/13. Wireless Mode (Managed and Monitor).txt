monitor mode: to enable us to capture
all the packets that are within range

iwconfig - this is to see all the wireless interfaces
only
Managed - meaning that you are only going to capture
all the packets that has your MAC address as its 
destination MAC
Monitor - meaning that you are able to capture
all the packets that doesn't have your MAC address
or have your MAC address as its destination MAC

this is how: 
> ifconfig wlan0 down
> airmon-ng check kill
> iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
> ifconfig wlan0 up

note: 
this airmon-ng check kill is going to kill any process
that could interfere us changing to monitor mode
this is not mandatory but it's going to make better results
this is also going to kill our internet connection

to check your interface mode you can type this:
> iwconfig

note:
not all your adapter are able to support monitor mode
you need to make sure that your actual adapter support 
something called monitor mode

THIS IS TO REENABLE THE MANAGED MODE:
ifconfig wlan0 down
ifconfig wlan0 mode managed
ifconfig wlan0 up
sudo service network-manager restart
