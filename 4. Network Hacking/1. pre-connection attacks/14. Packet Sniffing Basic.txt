PACKET SNIFFING USING AIRODUMP-NG
- part of the aircrack-ng suit
- airodump-ng is a packet sniffer
- used to capture all packets within range
- display detailed information about network
around us
- connected clients etc

after we are enabling our monitor mode we are now
able to do something which is capturing anything
that is sent within our range even if that packet
is not directed to us or doesn't hold our MAC address
as its destination MAC or even if our computer or device
is not connected to the network as long as it's within
our range

the thing that allows us to capture these packets
is called airodump-ng that is part of aircrack-ng suit
and it's a packet sniffer bassically a program
designed to capture packets while you're in monitor mode

this airodump-ng will allow us to see all the wireless
networks around us and show us detailed information
about its MAC address, channel, encryption, clients
connected to this network, and so on

HOW TO DO IT?
1. enable monitor mode in your wireless adapter
> iwconfig 
note: this is going to list all the network interfaces
in our machine make sure that the interface that you are
using to connect to the network is actually 
in monitor mode
2. doing it
> airodump-ng wlan0
note:
this is going to show some useful information
if you want to end the program you could just use
the ctrl+c key

BSSID - the mac address of the wireless adapters
PWR - this is the signal strength or the signal of the network
the higher the better
Beacons - frame sent by the networks to broadcast
its existence
#Data - these are the useful packets that we'll talk about later
once we get to the cracking section
#/s - this is the number of data packets that we collected
in the past 10 seconds
CH - this is the channel that the network works on
MB - this is the maximum speed supported by the network
ENC - this is the encryption used by the network
CIPHER - this is the cipher used by the network
AUTH - this is the authentication used by the network
ESSID - the name of the wireless adapters around us
