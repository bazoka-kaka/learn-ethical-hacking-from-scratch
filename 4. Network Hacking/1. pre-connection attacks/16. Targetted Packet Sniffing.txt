now we are going to just do some airodump-ng 
againts one network only to see more detailed information
that it could show

this is the command: 
> airodump-ng --bssid (the bssid) --channel (the channel
on that bssid) --write (file name) wlan0

note:
what we can see after this command is that 
we are gonna see just one network and we are gonna
see a completely new section which is just the devices
that are connected to that particular network

and after we do the sniffing we are now able to 
see in our current working directory that we have
multiple files
airodump-ng is going to automatically append -01
to our files so make sure the next time you do 
some airodump-ng you use the appending of
those file names with the -01 thing

the main file that we are going to be using 
is the .cap file which contains the datas
that we captured during the period that airodump-ng
was working on in here
bassically this .cap file should contain everything 
that was sent to and from our target network

it could contains the following:
- usernames
- passwords
- chat messages
- anything taht these devices did on the internet

since anything that they do have to be sent to the router

problem:
it's encrypted especially if it's WPA2 encrypted
it's not going to be easy to see something like packets
that are encrypted

this is to see the files:
> wireshark

after we open the .cap files we are gonna see all the packets
but these packets are encrypted therefore are useless
for us and the only thing that is useful for us
is the device manufacturer example it could be 
a certain computer with its manufacturer or something
like that (apple, windows, etc)

note:
this is not so useful is it? 

in the next lecture we are gonna learn about breaking
these things so we can see the passwords, usernames
in plain text

also you'll see how you can map all the computers
on the same network, gather detailed information
about them, hack into them, and really2 cool stuffs
