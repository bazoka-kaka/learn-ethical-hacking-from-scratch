DEAUTH ATTCK
============

- disconnect any clients from any network 
a. works on encrypted networks 
b. no need to know the network key
c. no need to connect to the network 

use:
> aireplay-ng --deauth [deauth packets] -a [network mac] -c [target mac] [interface]

what happens:
a. we pretend to be the client (by changing our mac address as the client's)
b. tell the router that i wanna disconnect from you 
c. we pretend to be the router (by changing our mac address as the router's)
d. tell the client that you've requested to be disconnected so i'll 
disconnect form you 

example:
> aireplay-ng --deauth 1000000 -a [router mac] -c [target mac] [interface]

note:
even if we disconnect the client, the client might connect to another network 
other than the one that we disconnect it from 

what you wanna do:
> airodump-ng --bssid [router mac] --channel [channel] [interface]

in another linux terminal:
> aireplay-ng --deauth [deauth packets] -a [network mac] -c [target mac] [interface]

social engineering idea:
do this then you should ask the person to install a backdoor 
that you say it'll fix their issues 

note:
you could also capture the handshake 
this is gonna be able to be used to crack wpa
