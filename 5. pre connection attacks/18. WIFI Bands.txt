WIFI BANDS - 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz Frequencies
========================================

- WIFI BANDS 
a. decides the Frequency range that can be used 
b. determines the channels that can be used 
c. clients need to support band used by router to communicate with it 
d. data can be sniffed from a certain band if the wireless adapter 
used supports that band 

- most common wifi bands:
a. a uses 5 GHz only
b. b, g both use 2.4GHz frequency only 
c. n uses 5 and 2.4 GHz 
d. ac uses frequencies lower than 6 GHz 

- sometimes, lots of the wifis aren't able to be seen 
this is because it's on different frequencies 

to configure airodump-ng to find all of the frequencies:
> airodump-ng --band abg wlan0 

note:
abg means the bands it's trying to find
