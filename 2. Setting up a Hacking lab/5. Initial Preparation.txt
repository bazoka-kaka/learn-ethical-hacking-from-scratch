INITIAL PREPARATION
===================

ENABLING VIRTUALIZATION 
VT-X/AMD-V/SVM

- feature required to start virtual machines
- enabled by default on apple computers
- might need to be enabled using BIOS on other computers 

checking if already enabled:
start --> task manager --> more details --> performance --> see virtualization (disabled or enabled)
(mine is enabled so deal with it)
