THE LAB - SNAPSHOTS
===================

- Snapshots allow you to save the of a virtual machine
- can be used as bookmarks to go back and forward
to different configurations
- Store stable state, updated state, etc

on your virtual box main menu you just 
go to your machine then click on the three bars
and click snapshots then click on the camera icon

you have to give your snapshots some short of 
description or name to make sure that you know
what is being snapshot there

then click ok

then we now have something called current state

you could just clickon the fresh install and install
that version you just snapshot before

note:
you have to make a snapshot every time you want to 
do a risky update

if you want to fresh install your thing that you just
inserted there you could do something called fresh install
or the restart button
